## Version Check

2. Compare against bootstrapped version `^^SAV:8.4.1^^`

   Your superpowers-agent may have updates. Run:
   ```sh
   superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
   ```

## Skill Loading Rules

- Load skills **JIT only** — never preload to "understand" them
- Follow skill instructions **exactly as written** — no skimming, no shortcuts
- If a skill has a checklist, create a todo for **each item** — no mental tracking
- Simple tasks benefit from skills as much as complex ones

**Skill priority (highest to lowest):** Project → Personal → Superpowers
